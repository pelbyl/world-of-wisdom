Enhance World of Wisdom

Critical Issues Found:

1. Security Vulnerabilities:
- HMAC keys are ephemeral - lost on server restart
- Log injection vulnerability - client input logged without sanitization
- Network protocol bugs - partial read vulnerability in binary protocol
- No replay attack prevention - nonces not tracked
- Race conditions - concurrent map access without synchronization
- Sensitive data in logs - solutions and client IDs exposed

1. Server Implementation Issues:
- God object anti-pattern - server.go has 800+ lines doing everything
- Resource leaks - unbounded caches, no connection limits
- Error handling - errors logged but not handled properly
- Missing timeouts - database operations can hang indefinitely

1. Database Problems:
- No connection pool configuration - risk of connection exhaustion
- Missing indexes - performance issues at scale
- TimescaleDB dependency - adds complexity, not fully utilized
- No transaction management - data consistency risks

1. Architecture Flaws:
- Tight coupling - direct database dependencies throughout
- Mixed concerns - business logic mixed with infrastructure
- No proper abstractions - PostgreSQL types leak into interfaces
- Single-server design - won't scale horizontally

1. Zero Test Coverage:
- Only 1 test file exists (for wisdom quotes)
- Core PoW functionality untested
- No integration tests
- No security tests
- No benchmarks

1. Protocol & Validation Issues:
- Integer overflow potential in binary protocol
- No bounds checking on network reads
- Missing input validation on challenge parameters
- Challenge format confusion - auto-detection can be spoofed

Recommendations (Priority Order):

Immediate Security Fixes:
1. Persist HMAC keys and implement key rotation
2. Sanitize all log inputs to prevent injection
3. Fix concurrent map access with proper synchronization
4. Add bounds checking to binary protocol parsing

High Priority Refactoring:
1. Extract services from server.go monolith
2. Implement proper connection pooling
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Create test suite for core functionality

Medium Priority Improvements:
1. Implement proper dependency injection
2. Add structured logging (e.g., zap)
3. Create abstraction layers for database
4. Add monitoring and alerting

Dead code - Remove it.

blockchain/blockchain.go

The blockchain.go file contains a toy implementation that:

1. Not actually used: The blockchain is initialized but never receives any data
2. In-memory only: Just an array of blocks with no persistence
3. No consensus mechanism: No proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, or any consensus
4. No network/distribution: Single instance, no peer-to-peer
5. No real integration: The API returns fake blockchain data from the database, not the blockchain instance

What it actually does:
- Creates a genesis block on initialization
- Has basic functions to add blocks and calculate SHA256 hashes
- Maintains a simple linked list of blocks in memory
- That's it - it's never actually used to store any PoW solutions

The API handlers fake blockchain functionality by:
- Converting database solutions to "blocks" for display
- Returning database counts as "blockchain stats"
- The TODO comments reveal this: // TODO: Get from blockchain when available

This is essentially dead code - a placeholder that was never integrated. The actual solution storage happens in PostgreSQL, and the "blockchain" visualization in
the web UI is just displaying database records formatted as blocks.

It's misleading to call this project blockchain-based when it's really a traditional database-backed system with an unused blockchain stub.
